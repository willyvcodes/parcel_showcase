# PARCEL SHOWCASE

This repository hosts a React project that I have developed as part of my Fullstack Developer application. The project consists of a small public REST API application in Node.js and two React views

## Getting Started

To run this project successfully, you'll need to set up a few environment variables. Here's how you can do it:

## Backend Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` directory.
2. Add your `BEARER_TOKEN` to the `.env` file. For example:
    BEARER_TOKEN=gmpVPwCtS1VRLJWEvMRqmCwWQDlG9MpJ2qZs1krTQhUqWe8MTyUZJD7eIHS3MaTT
3. (Optional) You can also set the `PORT` variable in the `.env` file to define the port on which you want the backend to run.

## Running the Application

nce you've set up the environment variables, you can start the application by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the project root directory.
2. Open a terminal window and run the following command to start the backend:

    cd backend
    
    npm start

3. Open another terminal window and run the following command to start the React App:
    
    cd frontend
    
    npm start
